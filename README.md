# Fully Homomorphic Encrypted Shazam

A secure Shazam implementation, using [Concrete](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete) for fully homomorphic encryption, implemented as the solution to the [Privacy Preserving Shazam Bounty](https://github.com/zama-ai/bounty-program/issues/79) in the [Zama Bounty Program](https://github.com/zama-ai/bounty-program).

We implement the algorithm as described in [1], and 2, augmented with homomorphic encryption for achieving security. Below are [System Architecture](#system-architecture), [Usage](#usage), and [References](#references).

## System Architecture

Our algorithm mimics the techniques described in the original paper while adapting some parts for securing user data via homomorphic encryption. The central entities of the system are the Song Database and the Query, below is a visual description of the contents of those entities.

In the figure, you can see 4 data types, enclosed in sharp-edged rectangles: `Song Database`, `Song`, `Query`, and `Address Couple` where `Address Couple` is indeed a combination of two smaller data types `Address` and `Couple`. This figure represents the data in its post-processed form. Initially, all we have is a set of `.mp3` files. For each song, we construct a **[spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram)** that represents the frequencies of the song and generate a **constellation map**. A constellation map is a simplified spectrogram, acquired by separating the spectrogram into separate frequency bands and picking the *strongest* signal.

Using the constellation map, we generate address couples. An address is a $(frequency, frequency, \Delta t)$ triple. Addresses are generated by
